# Welcome to My Mouse
***

## Task
The objective of the my_mouse project is to write a maze-solving program. Given a text file with the first line describing the size of the maze and the valid characters of the maze, the output of the program is the solved maze with the shortest path drawn between the start and end points.

## Description
The maze solving algorithm utilized in this program was breadth-first search. This algorithm finds the path by expanding evenly in all directions, exploring neighboring path nodes before moving on to the next level of neighbors. Once the exit is found, the shortest path is drawn on the maze by tracing back the path until the start point is reached.

## Installation
To compile this program, type `make`

## Usage
To run the program with a maze file, run the following command: 
`./my_mouse <path to map file>`
